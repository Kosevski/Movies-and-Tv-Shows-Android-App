# Movies and Tv Shows Android App

Watchio is an android application where the user can look up new and trending movies and tv shows, find details about them and find similar movies/tv shows with couple of clicks. The development of this application is not over yet and many features are to be added. 

In this application i used the MVVM design pattern and some Clean Architecture rules as you can see in the source code.

The API for the REST calls i used is from: https://www.themoviedb.org
